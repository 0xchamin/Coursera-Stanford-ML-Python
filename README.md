# Coursera-Stanford-ML-Python
Coursera/Stanford Machine Learning course assignments in python

Assignments for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course implemented in python. The code and results are structurally and numerically equivalent to the Matlab implementation from Coursera. Students can submit the assignments to the Coursera website by executing the submit.py script. The credentials will be saved to a file for subsequent submissions, e.g:

```bash
cd Coursera-Stanford-ML-Python/ex1
python submit.py
