# Coursera-Stanford-ML-Python
Coursera/Stanford Machine Learning course assignments in python

Assignments for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course implemented in python without solutions and is thus in line with the [Coursera code of Honor](https://www.coursera.org/about/terms/honorcode "Coursera Honor Code"). The code is structurally equivalent to the Matlab implementation from Coursera and the results can be numerically equivalent with the correct python implementation of the incomplete scripts. After completing each assignment, students can submit to the Coursera website for grading by executing the submit.py script. The credentials will be saved to a file for subsequent submissions, e.g:

```bash
cd Coursera-Stanford-ML-Python/ex1
python submit.py
